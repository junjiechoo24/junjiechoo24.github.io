<h2 style="margin-top: -1.5rem;">My Journey into Psychology</h2>

Welcome. This site is a living document of my journey from the tech industry into the world of philosophy and psychological science. It's a space where I document my projects, share reflections on my reading, and explore the ideas that are shaping my path.

## Why I am Pivoting

While my career in data engineering was intellectually challenging and rewarding, I felt a growing desire to apply my skills to challenges that felt more fundamentally human. This wasn't a sudden decision, but a gradual realisation that I wanted my work to contribute to something more meaningful, to understanding and potentially alleviating the struggles inherent in the human condition.

This search for a more purposeful path led me to philosophy and psychology.

My exposure to existential philosophy came at a pivotal point. What began as an intellectual curiosity soon became a framework for resilience. I found solace in the works of Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre, and Frankl, each demonstrating how meaning can serve as a foundation for psychological strength. Frankl’s reflections, in particular, resonated with me, reshaping my understanding of adversity.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

This philosophical grounding naturally extends to mental health and humanistic psychology. Together, they create a framework not just for enduring life, but for thriving within it, showing how individuals can discover their own authentic values and begin to cultivate a life that is truly worth living.

## This Digital Space

Here, I intend to put these ideas into practice. This space will be my open notebook as I transition into this new field. You will find:

*   **Projects:** Projects relating to tech, psychology, or whatever, that sparked my curiosity.
*   **Writings:** Reflections on the books and papers I am reading in psychology, philosophy, and statistics.
*   **Gallery:** Occasional photos that, for me, capture a particular perspective on the world.

Thank you for reading this far!

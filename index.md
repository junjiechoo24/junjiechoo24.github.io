My technical credentials in statistics and data engineering define part of my professional identity. But to build a deeper connection, I invite you to discover the "why" behind my journey into psychology.

### The Spark: An Existential Grounding

My exposure to existentialism came at a pivotal point. What began as an intellectual curiosity soon became a deeply personal framework for resilience. I found solace in the works of Nietzsche, Camus, and Frankl, each demonstrating how meaning can serve as a foundation for psychological strength.

Frankl’s reflections, in particular, resonated with me, reshaping the way I understood adversity and the power of finding meaning in suffering.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

### The Bridge: From Philosophy to Psychological Science

I soon recognized that the same existential insights that had given me strength held the potential to transform the lives of others. This sparked my fascination with the intersection of existential philosophy and contemporary psychological frameworks.

Existential thinkers have long argued that individuals actively construct their reality through subjective experience. Meanwhile, cognitive science offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of attention, interpretation, and schema formation, providing an empirical basis for understanding how these subjective realities are formed. The deeper I explore these intersections, the more I realize that the overlap of psychology and philosophy is profound, and it is what inspires me to pursue this field at the university level.

### The Vision: A Humanistic Approach

This pursuit naturally extends to humanistic psychology, which, like existentialism, emphasizes authenticity, meaning, and subjective experience. I am amazed by how core humanistic elements, especially unconditional positive regard, can cause profound changes by alleviating self-doubt and fostering self-acceptance. In that space, individuals gain clarity about the values that are deeply authentic to them.

I know this because I have experienced it firsthand: the realization of “I am, therefore I matter” leading to lasting change. It is this very truth that I aspire to affirm in others.

Ultimately, this guides my long-term vision: to establish a non-profit therapy center specializing in existential-humanistic psychotherapy, dedicated to supporting individuals facing emotional distress and the deeper challenges of human existence.

### The Commitment: A Deliberate Path

Leaving behind a stable career to embark on this journey is my deliberate step toward a life defined by meaning and authenticity. It is not an easy choice, but it feels right. Reflecting on the path I am about to undertake, I recall Nietzsche's challenge: to imagine that every action in one's life might be repeated endlessly, and to ask whether I would accept such a fate.

To this, I want to be able to say “Yes.”

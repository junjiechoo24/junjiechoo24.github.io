Welcome. This site is a living document of my journey from the tech industry into the world of philosophy and psychological science. It's a space where I document my projects, share reflections on my reading, and explore the ideas that are shaping my path.

It is a portfolio, but it is also a journey of self-discovery made public.

### A Pivot Towards Meaning

While my career in data engineering was intellectually challenging and rewarding, I felt a growing desire to apply my skills to challenges that felt more fundamentally human. This wasn't a sudden decision, but a gradual realization that I wanted my work to contribute to something more meaningful, to understanding and potentially alleviating the struggles inherent in the human condition.

This search for a more purposeful path led me to philosophy and psychology.

### Intellectual Foundations

My exposure to existentialism came at a pivotal point. What began as an intellectual curiosity soon became a framework for resilience. I found solace in the works of Nietzsche, Camus, and Frankl, each demonstrating how meaning can serve as a foundation for psychological strength. Frankl’s reflections, in particular, resonated with me, reshaping my understanding of adversity.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

This philosophical grounding naturally extends to humanistic psychology. I believe that rigorous, data-driven methods can be powerfully combined with a humanistic ethos to explore the mechanisms of growth, self-acceptance, and meaning-making.

### This Digital Space

Here, I intend to put these ideas into practice. This space will be my open notebook as I transition into this new field. You will find:

*   **Projects:** My hands-on work applying quantitative methods to psychological data.
*   **Writings:** Reflections on the books and papers I am reading in psychology, philosophy, and statistics.
*   **Photography:** Occasional works of art that, for me, capture a particular perspective on the world.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.

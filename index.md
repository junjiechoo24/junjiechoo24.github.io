Welcome. This site is a living document of my journey from data engineering into the world of psychological science. It's a space where I document my projects, share reflections on my reading, and explore the ideas that are shaping my path.

It is a portfolio, but it is also a journey of self-discovery made public.

### The Spark: An Existential Grounding

My exposure to existentialism came at a pivotal point. What began as an intellectual curiosity soon became a framework for resilience. I found solace in the works of Nietzsche, Camus, and Frankl, each demonstrating how meaning can serve as a foundation for psychological strength.

Frankl’s reflections, in particular, resonated with me, reshaping my understanding of adversity.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

### The Bridge: Science with a Humanistic Heart

This philosophical grounding naturally extends to humanistic psychology, which emphasizes authenticity, meaning, and subjective experience. I believe that rigorous, data-driven methods can be powerfully combined with a humanistic ethos.

My goal is not just to analyze data, but to understand the lived experiences behind it. It's to use the tools of science to affirm the value of the individual and to explore the mechanisms of growth, self-acceptance, and meaning-making.

### This Digital Space

Here, I intend to put these ideas into practice. This space will be my open notebook as I transition into this new field. You will find:

*   **Projects:** My hands-on work applying quantitative methods to psychological data.
*   **Writings:** Reflections on the books and papers I am reading in psychology, philosophy, and statistics.
*   **Photography:** Occasional works of art that, for me, capture a particular perspective on the world.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.

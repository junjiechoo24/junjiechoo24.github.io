My technical credentials in statistics and data engineering define part of my professional identity. But to build a deeper connection, I invite you to discover the "why" behind my journey into psychology.

### The Spark: An Existential Grounding

My exposure to existentialism came at a pivotal point. What began as an intellectual curiosity soon became a deeply personal framework for resilience. I found solace in the works of Nietzsche, Camus, and Frankl, each demonstrating how meaning can serve as a foundation for psychological strength.

Frankl’s reflections, in particular, resonated with me, reshaping the way I understood adversity and the power of finding meaning in suffering.

### The Vision: A Humanistic Approach

This pursuit naturally extends to humanistic psychology, which, like existentialism, emphasizes authenticity, meaning, and subjective experience. I am amazed by how core humanistic elements, especially unconditional positive regard, can cause profound changes by alleviating self-doubt and fostering self-acceptance. In that space, individuals gain clarity about the values that are deeply authentic to them.

I know this because I have experienced it firsthand: the realization of “I am, therefore I matter” leading to lasting change. It is this very truth that I aspire to affirm in others.

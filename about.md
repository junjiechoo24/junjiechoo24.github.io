### From Data Engineering to Psychological Science

For years, my career has been rooted in the world of data. As a Data Engineer, I've built robust pipelines, wrangled massive datasets, and constructed complex models. I solve problems with code, logic, and infrastructure. Yet, I found myself increasingly drawn to the most complex system of all: the human mind.

#### The Spark
My curiosity was first sparked by reading foundational works in philosophy and psychology, from Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" to modern explorations of cognitive science. This wasn't just casual reading; it was a systematic effort to understand the core questions and methods of the field. I realized that the "why" behind human behavior was a far more compelling problem to me than the "how" of data infrastructure.

#### The Connection
I began to see a bridge between my two worlds. The skills I honed in industry—ensuring data integrity, performing complex statistical analyses in R and Python, and managing the entire data lifecycle—are precisely the skills required to conduct rigorous, reproducible psychological research. The "what" of psychology fascinated me, and I already possessed the "how".

#### The Goal
My objective is to pivot my career into a research setting where I can be a "force multiplier" for a lab. I want to apply my deep quantitative and technical expertise to help answer fundamental questions about human psychology. I am not just looking for a job; I am looking to contribute to a field I am deeply passionate about.
